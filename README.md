# 🛠️ Coding Buddy
### AI-powered coding assistant that turns natural language into working projects.

**Coding Buddy** is built with **LangGraph** and behaves like a multi-agent dev team: it takes a plain-English request and produces a complete, runnable codebase — file by file — following real developer workflows.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Planner Agent** — analyzes your request and drafts a detailed project plan.  
- **Architect Agent** — decomposes the plan into explicit engineering tasks with file-level context.  
- **Coder Agent** — implements tasks, writes files, and uses available tools like a real developer.
