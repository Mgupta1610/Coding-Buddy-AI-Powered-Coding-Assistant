🛠️ Coding Buddy
Coding Buddy is an AI-powered coding assistant built with LangGraph that functions as a multi-agent development team to transform natural language requests into complete, working code projects.
It works like a multi-agent development team that can take a natural language request and transform it into a complete, working project — file by file — using real developer workflows.
